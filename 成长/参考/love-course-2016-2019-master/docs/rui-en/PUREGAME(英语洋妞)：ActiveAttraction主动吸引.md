# PURE GAME (英语洋妞)：Active Attraction 主动吸引

Hey， what's up guys？，It's Jen here， and in this module。

I'm gonna go over everything that you have to know， about attraction。

 and generating strong attraction with women， when you're going out and meeting them。

 Now what you need to know is basically attraction， is broken down into two different parts。

 the first part is what I call active attraction， which is something that you're actively doing going up。

 to generate the value， to generate attraction from her。

 and the second type is called passive attraction， which is something that she is doing， for example。

 shittest towards you， and that's creating the attraction。

 that's basically amplifying the attraction， that she already has for you， okay。

 so two different types， Now I want to go over the very first type， in this video。

 and in the next video I'm going to explain， how to generate and get passive attraction from her。

 okay， so in terms of active attraction， in terms of what you're doing。

 that's getting her invested in you， and really attracted to you。

 you have to understand this whole thing about value， okay， so when it comes to meeting women。

 what women are really attracted to， are men of value， okay， now when I'm talking about value。

 I'm not talking about how much money you have， what car are you driving， what's your fucking status。

 how good looking are you， I'm not talking about that， okay， the value I'm talking about here。

 is your perceived social value， okay， so when it comes to giving value。

 when it comes to having value okay， what you really have to understand about value。

 is that when you're able to walk up to a girl， off of the approach。

 if you're able to basically project， and just give value。

 girls will automatically be attracted to you， okay， so now you're going to ask me。

 what the fuck is value， so the value that I'm talking about here。

 is broken down into basically four different things， okay， and the very first thing。

 in terms of you know having value， is what I call intent， okay， be on your purpose。

 like this whole thing with being purposeful， and being clear in your intent， so this is number one。

 so what you need to do is when you walk up to someone。

 and when you're initially you know meeting someone。

 everything you say and you have everything that you do， there has to be a purpose behind it okay。

 so as an example， you can't it's not going to work if you walk up to some girl。

 and you know you're not really into what you're saying， you're walking up。

 you're kind of like hiding your intentions， like you know you're interested in the girl。

 but you're walking up， make up some dumb excuses， almost apologetic for talking to her， okay。

 it's not going to work if you walk up， and just go like you know almost like a dead fish。

 like hey how's it going guys like， I think you guys are so cute。

 like it want to you know if I see that shit， it's not going to fucking work， okay。

 I've seen guys go and do that all the time， so if you go in and you're like pretty much like a dead fish。

 with no purpose behind what you say， it's not going to work out for you， okay。

 you're not going to get that attraction， so you have to be purposeful。

 behind what you're saying like everything you say， when I say be clear and your intent。

 what I really mean is， saying what is on your mind and not having a filter in all， okay。

 and when you're saying it， you're absolutely 100% committed to your actions， okay。

 whether it's things that you say or things that you do， so in terms of what you're saying。

 if I'm thinking about something， I just fucking let it out I just say it， okay， if I have an idea。

 if something pops into my head， I just let it out of my head， okay。

 that's called being clear and your intent， what you think is what you do is what you say， okay。

 now number two is actually self-amusement， okay， this one is fucking huge， so with self-amusement。

 what you have to understand about that is， when you go out， everything has to be about you， okay。

 like going out， everything you do and say， has to be 100% for yourself okay， not for the girl。

 it has to be for your own joy， so when you're going out， when you're interacting with somebody。

 when you're interacting with a really fucking hot girl， the things that you talk about。

 you're not trying to come from a frame or think， like you're not trying to come from a mindset。

 and a place where it's like， does she like is she gonna find this funny， okay。

 or is she gonna find this interesting， it's gonna be do you find this interesting， okay。

 like do you find this funny， so if I'm talking about certain things。

 if I don't want to talk about it， because I don't think it's funny at all。

 and I don't find anything interesting， I am not gonna talk about it， okay。

 I don't even think about the girl， or what she likes to fucking hear， okay。

 it's gonna be something that's from you， so when I say that， an element of self-amusement， so sorry。

 the element of self-amusement， what it really is， is almost going in。

 and joking around with yourself， or the people around you， okay。

 it's almost like you're hanging out with a group of friends， there's absolutely no filter， okay。

 if something arises that you think it's funny， you want to share with them， okay。

 this is exactly what it is， like you go up to our girl。

 if anything that you think is interesting and funny， you share it with her， okay。

 now obviously not ever girls gonna find your joke funny。

 not ever girls gonna find this that you say interesting， but you have to calibrate from that。

 so basically， sometimes when I go in， in terms of self-amusement。

 I may say things that are pretty fucking out there。

 where a girl will not find that interesting at all， okay， so for example I make some joke about。

 my roommate being a terrorist， okay， because my roommate is brown。

 and I make a joke about him being a terrorist， and some girls like not into either。

 like they don't find that funny at all， and then there are girls who like laugh their ass off， okay。

 so if I go in with that kind of self-amusement， and I talk about you know something that they don't even find funny。

 what I would do is I would switch on to something else， but everything that I'm doing。

 it's all for my own fun， okay， it's all for my own purpose。

 so when you go out like you want to try to make things fun， for yourself。

 and especially with self-amusement， there's no longer like the better the more you can self-amuse。

 the better your night goes， okay， the better your night is gonna go。

 the more girls you're actually gonna be able to hook and pick up。

 because self-amusement is in my opinion， the one cure。

 like literally the one thing that just prevents， when you get blown out。

 obviously like when you're starting out in this， you feel really fucking bad。

 but if the moment you can start really self-amuse， it kind of like being your own world。

 and kind of just go up and like share your positive， and fun energy with people。

 there's literally no such thing as rejection anymore， because you're going up simply just giving。

 whatever you find funny， giving whatever your energy， giving your positive energy。

 giving your ideas that the fun things， or the funny things that come to your mind。

 and you're just sharing it with people， there's really no such thing as rejection。

 because some people will find it funny， some people won't， okay。

 like you won't even think about getting fucking rejected， okay。

 that's why it's really really important to self-amuse， okay。

 and the third point that I want to talk about， is having this internal freedom， okay。

 internal freedom， now what this is， is simply not having a filter， okay。

 and just say and do whatever you want， okay， it's almost like having a nice flow when you speak。

 you're not hesitant， so if something that you want to talk about， something you want to ask her。

 let's say you want to lead the girl somewhere， you want to just say something， you want to say。

 take her hand， or you want to say go for a hug， or you want to say， I'll pull her into you。

 just go for it， okay， like if you want to take the action， don't hesitate， okay， when you hesitate。

 when you're doubting yourself， a lot of times it doesn't fucking work， okay。

 you don't want to doubt yourself， it's like it's literally like a lack of confidence。

 when you don't doubt yourself， when everything kind of just goes with a flow。

 when you're kind of just having this nice flow， where you're not thinking so much。

 and you're just being present in the moments， it's a shit fucking ton of value。

 and girls love to go with it， okay， they love to go with it， when you're just in the moments。

 because women they live literally by the moment， they don't think so much about。

 they don't analyze so much about shit， especially when you go into like night game， okay。

 like when girls， you know， they've had a few drinks。

 they're literally just living on what's in front of them， right now， okay， so when you're going in。

 the way to get in this like nice flow， this nice internal freedom， is you have to really let go。

 of this thing called your self-image， okay， you really have to let go， of how you think you look。

 how you're going to look or what you want to look like， okay， so what I mean by this， is your ego。

 like your own personal fucking ego， is attached to your self-image， okay。

 it's attached to who you are， who you think you are， so when most guys go out。

 they want to avoid actually looking like a retard， okay， they don't want to look stupid。

 guys always try too hard to look cool， okay， or look， you know， a certain way。

 so they're always trying hard to look awesome， okay， nobody wants to look fucking stupid。

 nobody wants to make a fool of himself， and everybody just takes themselves way too fucking serious。

 okay， most guys， so when you go out， the way to get into this nice flow， like internal freedom。

 and just be able to full on express yourself， you know， freely， without any sort of hesitation。

 without any sort of filter， the way you would do that， is when you go out。

 don't try to pick up a girl， right off the bat， okay， like there's this period。

 what I call like warm-ups， so what I mean is when you first approach， you know when you go out。

 you approach the first go， you talk to you then the second and the third。

 usually the first half an hour to an hour， see it as your warm-up， okay， you're just mingling。

 getting yourself social， getting yourself， getting your brain going。

 so that you're no longer analyzing， and thinking so much， because that could happen sometimes。

 if you're staying inside for too long， or you know， you play video games for too long。

 or you're working your job for too long， and you see a girl you want to talk to。

 you all suddenly you're in your head， so when you're going out。

 spend the first half an hour to an hour， simply just being social， okay。

 be like social friendly and cool， you're not trying to pick anybody up。

 be willing to say stupid things， be willing to basically laugh at yourself。

 be willing to make a joke out of everything， okay， like don't take it fucking serious。

 do not take yourself serious at all， okay， like nothing's a big fucking deal。

 and once you can do that， once you can actually walk up to somebody。

 freely express yourself in a way that， you're not afraid to look like a retard， or just look stupid。

 what that does is， you know a lot of times when I go out， I actually purposely will go up to。

 you know the first go I taught you， or the second girl。

 I'll actually purposely say something really， fucking stupid， okay。

 I'll even like say something stupid， about myself， I'll even do something really stupid， okay。

 like I'll walk up make some sort of， dumb noise in the middle of the conversation。

 or I'll go out pretending to have a， fucking seizure kind of like， kind of like a fucking re-tired。

 I purposely do that， so I lose that whole like self image， like it's fucking gone， it's almost like。

 you go to some sort of social events， you're at a party。

 and something really embarrassing happens to you， because something like。

 absolutely fucking embarrassing happens to you， where everyone looks at you， in the room， and um。

 literally after that happens， you no longer give a shudder up， you you stop giving a shit。

 about what people think about you， because that self image has been destroyed， like it's been lost。

 okay， like it's gone， so you're not ever going to think about it again， and literally after that。

 you can just start being yourself， it's almost like a big ass， fucking weight off of you， just like。

 whew， now you can say what other， fuck you want， you can do what other， fuck you want。

 and it's just， this carefree feeling， where your brain will actually。

 allow itself to be more creative， because there's no longer this， expectation。

 to be fucking awesome， to be cool， to look， you know， James Bond like， okay。

 so it's really important， to have this nice， internal freedom， and nice flow， okay， as you're going。

 into having every single interaction， okay， now the very fourth element， the last element。

 is what I call being， grounded， okay， being grounded， now what this means。

 it's almost like when you're walking up， now you got everything that you want to say。

 your self amused， and you're very clear in your intents， the way that you want to deliver all that。

 is in a way that is very controlled， and you're grounded， so when a girl looks into your eyes。

 when a girl looks into my eyes， she could tell everything about me。

 by basically looking into my eyes， okay， and if you're a guy let's say， walking up。

 your subcommunication， you're very flinchy， you're very kind of like， all over the place。

 you move around too much， you're not very fucking grounded， okay， you're not very very。

 you're not grounded at all， so the reason why a lot of women， are attracted to。

 you know guys who are older， and men will actually start developing this， you know， when they age。

 when they grow older， is with you know， the more life experience they have， they stop caring about。

 you know， shit， and they become a little bit more grounded， you'll see this in much older men。

 like that old man， who sits at a coffee shop， like you can go up， say anything to him。

 and he doesn't even go a fuck， okay， and that's literally what you want to have。

 is like that groundedness， where， everything you say and do， is coming from a place of。

 like it's very controlled， okay like you're a solid， solid rock， where， no matter what she says。

 no matter what happens around you， no matter what people say to you。

 you are not emotionally affected， okay it doesn't， your internal， sense of yourself， yourself worth。

 is not dependent on anything external， okay so basically， whatever you feel about yourself。

 whatever you want to do， in terms of you know， things you want to say， and your opinions。

 and things that you want to do， like touching， or maybe taking her somewhere。

 is not affected at all， okay so you're， you're basically like you're on your track。

 you're not affected whatsoever， by anything external， okay so what， random dudes will say to you。

 or random girls will say to you， well you know the girls that you approach。

 whatever they say to you， doesn't， fucking matter， okay don't be emotionally affected， for example。

 you know this actually has to do， with the other video， I'm going to talk about。

 in terms of shit test， for example if a girl， makes fun of you， and says now let's see your。

 approach her， and the girl goes oh my god， your shirt looks gay， if you're a guy who is fucking。

 grounded， you know you pretty much， just like laugh at that show， you're like， huh， thank you。

 and move on， okay like move on from there， but a guy who say， not grounded。

 would actually emotionally， react to a comment like that， and either become。

 apologetic and start explaining himself， or what he'll do is overly compensate。

 and actually make fun of her， because of his insecurities， and blah blah blah blah， okay。

 so that's the main thing about being grounded， is not being emotionally affected。

 and everything that's coming from you， okay especially if you have a lot of energy。

 is putting it out in a very controlled， manner okay， so you're not kind of like all over the place。

 okay you're not like a little boy， who's going up to the girl， and just like oh my god。

 blah blah blah blah blah blah， not a fucking dancing monkey， okay you want to be a fucking man。

 who's like， solid， stable and rooted， in terms of where you stand， in terms of what you say。

 in terms of what you do， okay even when you touch her， even when you try to you know， initiate。

 physicality， it's like you're going in， and you're touching her， and you're， you're initiating。

 you know the hug， or you know pull her in， or grabbing her hands， in a way that is like， tsch。

 okay it's like very very controlled， not very it's like， no abrupt movements。

 okay so very very controlled， movements in terms of physicality， and that just shows like。

 being very very grounded， so those four things， being on your purpose， okay self amusement。

 internal freedom， and， forgot the other one， being grounded， so these four things。

 really really sets the value， and attraction for women， okay like when they feel that， from you。

 they just can't help but be， attracted， and that's literally what， like confidence。

 and being yourself， means okay if i were to breaking it down， and uh what this whole thing i want。

 bring it into， is actually this whole idea， about， self expression， okay so basically what society。

 has taught us， you know growing up as a kid， especially for me。

 basically what society has taught us， growing up is that you need to be， you know impressive。

 okay you always have to try to impress， the girl， you have to buy her shit。

 you have to pay for her shit， you have to buy her gifts， you have to make this for her。

 you have to do this for her， you have to drive her home， you do all this shit for her。

 trying to get fucking late， you're trying to get the girl to like you， that it doesn't fucking work。

 because society， features this idea that you need to be， impressive， so instead of trying to be。

 impressive， what you need to focus on， in this whole thing about， like， self expression。

 okay this whole idea about， expressing yourself， freely， okay and what that means。

 is being able to simply walk up， to someone， and never judge yourself， in any way。

 where anything that comes out of your， mouth， to a girl， it's either， like it's neither right。

 like nothing you say is， right， or wrong， okay like there's no such thing。

 as a low value thing to say， and there's no such thing， as a high value thing to say。

 so when you go up to a girl， like don't ever think， anything you say is like， right or wrong。

 okay there's no such thing， all there is， is this whole idea， about being， self expression。

 and self expressive， so everything that comes from you， is simply an expression of who you are。

 okay so like， I'm Jan， and if I walk up to a girl， doesn't matter what I say。

 like something that I could say， something that I say， could let's say get a really attracted。

 or something that I say， can make her really offended， now it doesn't matter what it is。

 I'm not judging what comes out of my mouth， okay but at the same time， I'm very calibrated。

 so if I see that I see something， that's very offensive， and she started to get， you know。

 uncomfortable， or actually get offended， what I do is， I would calibrate， and take a step back。

 okay， tone it down， switch topics， move on from that， okay， but it still doesn't change the idea。

 of being expressive， and saying whatever is on my mind， so when it comes to， talking to girls。

 meeting girls， it literally doesn't matter， what comes out of your mouth。

 you want to think about it， as a form of your own expression， of who you are。

 okay like even with touching， when I go up， and I'm， when I'm engaging a girl。

 when I'm initiating physicality， I'm literally， expressing myself， physically。

 okay it's just simply an expression， of my own intentions， towards this girl。

 I wouldn't want to touch a girl， if I didn't like her， if I didn't find her attractive， okay。

 I wouldn't be let's say making jokes， and being all self-immused， and interested， show intent。

 if I didn't find the girl attractive， okay so you want， everything to come， from internally。

 you want everything that comes out of you， from a place of， inside where it's genuine。

 where you genuinely want to， and the only way you can do that， is to get rid of all this。

 bullshit about like， trying to hold out this image， or this， you know impression。

 making a good fucking impression， get rid of all that， like rip it out， okay， learn to just be。

 fucking free， if you walk up to a girl， and you're being yourself， or quote-unquote being yourself。

 being free and expressing， and sorry， expressing who you are， and she doesn't like that。

 well guess what， you guys probably don't have chemistry， anyways， so when I'm walking up to a girl。

 I am literally， everything that comes from me， is simply from a place of， like genuine。

 and authenticity， okay it's like literally who I am， and I'm expressing it。

 in the most expressive way possible， so she gets a much bigger sample of who I am。

 okay so when she gets that， a girl can make a decision， about do I want to talk to him。

 or do I not want to talk to him， okay like that's what this is all about。

 it's actually going up to a girl， expressing herself， and see if there's actually chemistry。

 between you guys， okay， and that is active attraction， it's going up and actively。

 actively saying things， and doing things， to create the attraction， between you and her。

 okay that is， active attraction， stay tuned for the next video。
