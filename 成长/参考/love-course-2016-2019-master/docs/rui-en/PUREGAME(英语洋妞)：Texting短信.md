# PURE GAME (英语洋妞)：Texting 短信

嗯。。。， text guidelines and dates，ok，所以 first of all， like， talk my text first。

 because that's the follow up， to like let's say get the date for you， ok。

 so when you initially go up， I want to start talking about。

 from the very first interaction you go up， how do you number close？， like what。

 what kind of criteria does it need， for you to have a solid number close？。

 like the interaction has to be， like she has to be like close， ok what does that mean though？。

 like she's like invested in the interaction， like she's like looking at me， and she's like。

 smiling as well， ok so she's actually emotionally invested。

 ok she has to be somewhat emotionally invested， she has to actually feel something。

 right which means if you just go up， and have like conversation， and you're like。

 hey where are you from？， you know that's cool， how old are you？， oh nice， hey what now？。

 so what's your number？， does she feel anything？， nothing， there's nothing there， right？。

 so if you give you a number， the chance of that number being a flick， is really really high。

 so to even get a solid number close， you must， must must， have a very solid initial interaction。

 and what that means is， like you have to basically， get to go to emotionally invested。

 ok and we talked about， before many ways， get to go to emotionally invested in you。

 one is to be a little bit what？， polarizing？， once to be polarizing， right？。

 once to be very polarizing， which is like kind of like。

 seeing and talk about things that are kind of like， a little bit extreme。

 and then come back from that， like back and forth， back and forth， be unpredictable， right？。

 be self-amused， so all of the things we talked about， that generates emotion from a girl。

 like you have seen me basically， you know hold the stand， and get them really emotionally hooked。

 and that's how you would actually get a solid number， is when they're emotionally invested。

 now what's number two？， ok so they got to be emotionally invested， what else？。

 it's been like a lot of time， sometimes sometimes you only have let's say two minutes。

 during the day game， ok so that's not always the case。

 you're not always going to be able to spend a lot of time with them。

 ok so number one is you get them emotionally invested， number two， anything else？。

 it was becoming more with you， just a certain degree， you have the seed， the day two。

 do you understand that？， you can't just talk to a girl， and then be like， what's your number？。

 ok you can't， you have to make， because when you do it that way。

 you make it seem like you're getting the whole girl， this interaction will get the number。

 you make it seem like you talk into her， this entire time that you talk into her。

 is just to get a number， as if it's some fucking trophy， the whole point of you talking to her。

 is so that you want to see this girl again， you want to hang out with her。

 let's make some sort of plan， at least suggest something， before you even ask for the number。

 that's how you solidify it， because the number don't point importance on the number。

 so when you're going， when you want a number close， you want to be like。

 let's grab a coffee next week， downtown， 3 o'clock， Tuesday， are you free on Tuesday？。

 what are you doing on Tuesday？， oh you're busy？， cool， what about Wednesday？。

 what are you doing on Wednesday？， you're free on Tuesday？， okay， maybe a rubsan script。

 from me personally， I'm busy during the week， would it be better for me to ask for the next weekend。

 or if it was seven days after Sunday？， basically whatever your availability is。

 you ask her about that availability， do you get it？， so let's say you're only free at night time。

 you're like what are you doing on Wednesday night？， what are you doing on Saturday night？。

 what are you doing on Tuesday night？， you just ask that， and then be like yo， let's make a coffee。

 or let's make a drink， or let's go do this， because in your case， you wouldn't do for a coffee。

 like f**king 10 o'clock at night， so you can literally be like， let's go for a drink。

 or let's go grab a bite， Tuesday night， like a late night or something， or let's go for a ride。

 the whole point is you're suggesting an activity， that you're doing with her， with a specific time。

 with a specific location， with what you're doing， so it's like solid。

 that you're planting an actual seed， in her head， and it's like a property of asking a girl out。

 and then you go for the number， and then you just go， well what's your number？， I'll text you。

 or like you know what？， I'll call you or something， to set it up， or like to confirm。

 what's your number， then you go for the number， so that's number two， you solidify it， with a date。

 what's number three？， so now you've got the number， what's number three？， to make it a solid number。

 good， yeah， so you stay about like a minute or two， afterwards to talk， even a little bit more。

 so that's like， you're actually interested in her， you're not interested in like。

 just her fucking number， so usually like when I get a number close， now the only exception is that。

 if the girl is really like in a hurry， then I'll just get a number。

 and like she'll probably run off， because she's a little let's say， in a hurry to go to work。

 or in a hurry to like to go to a appointment， she's late， you can tell she's in a hurry。

 or she's going to the gym， or running home or something， like whatever it is。

 you can tell she's late， then you can't stay to talk， but generally， if the situation， allows。

 you stay behind， at least a couple of minutes， to like， torture her after you get the number。

 you do those three things， it will fucking increase your chance of， you know。

 getting a call back or something， or like a text back， so that they're not going to flake。

 they're not going to go silent， okay， now even if you do all three things。

 let's say she still goes silent， or doesn't text you， there also could be tons of reasons。

 for example， like I've had girls， like I didn't even know this， okay， and this literally。

 from hundreds and hundreds， and hundreds， even thousands of girls， that I went through。

 whether it's texting， or whether it's calling， or whether it's finding out， from them。

 or them telling me， so there could be a lot of， situations where let's say， she just got back。

 with her boyfriend， right， or she's going through a tough， time of life。

 where she's not ready to meet， anybody for whatever， she just gave me her number。

 because she gave me her number， right， I have a girl that， text me that， and then I have a girl。

 who's finding me， or finding out， and they'll tell me that as well， so there could be。

 a million reasons， why she wouldn't want to， text you back， or whatever， but if you're getting。

 like in general， let's say you're getting， like 10 numbers， if they all go silent。

 even though you did everything， that was right， then what the， really like the big problem is。

 it's not your text game， it's really your initial， interaction， okay it's your initial， interaction。

 you just didn't have a solid， connection， sometimes a girl can， actually pretend， that it was。

 an awesome time， like for example， we thought the interaction was， really awesome。

 and then she doesn't， fucking mess with you， back at all， yeah， and then you're like。

 well the initial， interaction was so good， what happened？， well guess what？。

 it was your perspective， maybe it wasn't solid at all， but you thought it was solid。

 like this is more of like， like a perspective thing， like I see a lot of guys。

 go up and talk to girls， girls were like， put on this front， where they're pretending。

 to be nice and polite， but the guy thinks， is a solid interaction， that is why it is。

 so important to get them， to be real with you， just because the girls， being nice to you。

 doesn't make sure， likes you， it could be fake， it could be， she's trying to be nice。

 and doesn't want to reject you， give you a fucking number， and a reality， she has no intention。

 of meeting up with you， whatsoever， so you got to get a real， interaction， out of them。

 like if you want to， be real with you， what are you going to do？， be real with them。

 yeah you're going to be real with them， like imagine， if when I first met you。

 like I'm not being real at all， I'm like， oh hey， hey I'm， I'm Jen and nice to me。

 yeah so you want to， you want to meet girls？， yeah man， like I need to join， to meet girls。

 do you know， like I'm like super good at this shit， you know， you just have not。

 being real with you， right？， not only does it make you uncomfortable， you're like。

 oh like what the fuck， like you probably， wouldn't be real， for me， right？， you probably。

 wouldn't want to talk to me， you're going to be real with you， don't try so hard。

 don't try to be somebody， that you are not， that's why the initial， interaction is so， so important。

 right？， to have like actual， interaction， when I say be real， I mean literally。

 just say what's on your mind， and like keep， keep things real， like there's no format。

 there's no formality， like when you approach， you like to set up， some sort of formality。

 like you like to set up， your approach， or like turn， it's almost like， you're turning a button on。

 like now you're approaching， like， turn on， right？， and then when you're not， a bunch like turn off。

 take that shit out， remember like how much， how much better it was， when you like took out。

 the whole game thing， just fucking be a normal dude， be yourself， because then。

 when they talk to you， dude they're human beings， they're not robots， like there's no algorithm。

 there's no algorithm， in like， getting them to hook， like getting girls to hook， is literally about。

 like the most authentic， you can possibly be， and to do that， you have to like， literally not give。

 any fuck about what people think about you， like you're fully， fully putting your personality。

 who you are， like， on the line， you're putting it on the fucking line， you're like。

 this is who I am， and you're going， I'm like， what's that？， blah blah blah blah， right？。

 it all starts， from literally the moment you approach， with like， like all that。

 takes into the shit， so that's why I'm talking about this right now， like you walk up。

 literally off of the approach， if you can get them to be， fucking real， with you right there。

 you connect， right？， you just spike some emotions， like， remember what I told you， like you want to。

 build a game on top of what， who you are， right？， so that's why going， out being authentic。

 is the most important thing， once you can do that， fully being authentic， even if you're like。

 say stifle， like remember you asked me earlier， like what if I'm， in my head。

 how do I get out of my head， well， number one， except that you're in your head， number two。

 going in and just， embraced and just show， you your head， and then the way you step。

 out of that is literally， say something， fucking stupid， that make yourself laugh。

 that's the start of self-admusement， it's being able to laugh， for yourself， make stupid jokes。

 I'll give you example， like when I was at the， when I took you guys， to the parties， on campus。

 at university， when I took you to the parties， when I'm there， with my wing， right？， when I'm there。

 with my assistant coach， like， he's in the talk， of these girls， one of the things I talk。

 about that I do is， I would tell girls， dumb， I would make up dumb stories， about myself。

 or about my friends， that girls， be like， oh how did you guys， meet， right？。

 I would make up some dumb stories， about how I met my friend， even though that's not true， right？。

 or I would point， at my friend， because let's see， he's got two girls， and I would make up。

 this dumb story， or scenario， about what's happening， right？， and they get into that， like that's。

 am I being myself， yeah， because I'm talking about， what I want to talk about， am I， am I into it？。

 yes， because I find it funny， interesting， because I find it， hilarious， and because of those。

 things they are into it， as well， like they get hooked， emotionally， right？。

 so on top of my personality， I add in the whole game thing， the whole game， with like， you know。

 amping up， sexuality， or amping up， like， you know， you're making them， emotionally， react。

 like hooking them， hard on that， right？， and then bringing them， back down a bit， to like。

 kind of connect， to be able to connect， so I can pump their， emotions， and then bring the emotions。

 down to， so I can connect with them， because you can't， really connect with the girl。

 if you're pumping her emotions， with like， all the jokes， all the self-improvement。

 the only way you can connect， is like， actual real talk， it's like， oh do you go to school here？。

 cool， okay， when the energy is not， so fucking high， because when the emotions， are high。

 it's all just like， super-in the moment， like it's hard， it's hard to connect， right？。

 when they're like， super excited， or like， they're buying temperatures， like， through the roof。

 right？， but that's also a good， time to escalate， by the way， okay？， I'll talk about escalation。

 later because you want to talk about， physical escalation， but yeah， so， so those， those two things。

 I talked about， basically have a solid， right？， and then， so， so have a solid interaction。

 where you could connect with them， and have a real interaction， and then you want to basically。

 have them， so emotionally， and that's new， and then you want to， seed the date。

 and then you stay a little bit， after the number to talk， right？， so now， those three are the main。

 criteria for getting a solid， fucking number， right？， so it's mostly due。

 with your initial interaction， now after that， text guidelines， okay？， what are you going to send。

 for texting？， so listen to this， so in terms of texting， what I do is this， my。

 everything that I send， in terms of text， I build it off， of these three， texts， okay？。

 the initial first three texts， I usually get the girl， come out， within three text messages。

 so the very first， text message， okay？， the rule is this， your first text， is always。

 so that she knows， who this is， you can send anything， and say， hey， nice to meet you， like， he。

 is the simplest thing， hey， nice to meet you， dash， gen， okay？， well， you can say， hey。

 this is the most， important number， you ever get， strobe care， dash， gen， or you can say some。

 sort of call back humor， right？， like， hey， shrimp girl， it's your shrimp daddy， gen， right？， well。

 like say， from that game， get home safe， gen， right？， so the whole idea， of the first message。

 she knows， who is， who is texting her， who this number is， now your second text。

 so now whatever she， replies， now， even if she doesn't， reply， okay？， oh， and by the way。

 the first text， you want to send it， ASAP， so within 20 minutes， an hour or two hours， okay。

 don't wait， for like five-six hours， like， send it， within that， time frame， like。

 no more than two hours， send it within two hours， I usually send it， within like 20 minutes。

 of meeting， okay？， a lot of guys， like to wait for like， three days， four days， like， that's。

 retarded， because they meet so many， guys like， hug girls， especially like， get。

 it posted by so many guys， probably give her， her number so much， even after one day， like 24 hours。

 sure they lost， or like， forgot a lot， of things like， emotions about you， like， who the fuck。

 you are， like， all that's gone， you got to hit the， iron， strike while it's， hot， right？。

 so literally after， you've taught， her， she knows what this is， now， after this， first text。

 let's say， she doesn't reply， or she replies， that doesn't matter， regardless。

 within about 24 hours， send your second text， so， if she replies， you send your second text。

 within about one， or two hours， or like， wait a little bit， okay？， if she doesn't reply。

 to your first text， so it's a little bit cold， rushes a little bit cold， you wait a day， 24 hours。

 you send your next text， so you're not needy， and desperate， okay？， only， only。

 send within a few hours， if she's， um，， she， like， replied， okay， so your second text。

 is always what I call， find out availability， okay？， you always want to text， with a purpose。

 you find out， her availability， don't bullshit， don't be a guy， don't bullshit。

 text for fucking no reason， for hours and hours， and hours and days， it's a waste of time， okay？。

 be efficient， be effective， and just get to the point， alright？， so your second text。

 is something along the lines， like， what's your。。。， yeah？， do you already ask。

 what are availability， in the initial interaction？， okay， that's only if， you've set the exact time。

 and date， but let's say you go， hey， let's me for coffee， next week， you know what？。

 what do you do next week， would you be me for coffee？， okay， what's the number？， in that case。

 you've got to find out， availability， right？， what if you asked for， like， Saturday night？。

 a lot of times， like， a lot of times， this if you see， you set up。。。， because a lot of times。

 when I try to， set up on the exact date， or time， a lot of them， are like， you know what？。

 I actually don't even know， all my skills， they're just going to be like， so I can't tell you。

 or they'll be like， you know what？， like， let's figure， out through text。

 and I can't really tell you， specifically when I'm， off or when I'm free， a lot of these people。

 like， they work， they have full-time jobs， and they have other， shit going on。

 so it's rare that I have， an interaction， where I have it， specifically set， even though I do。

 and I'll show you， like， text exam， these specific， text examples， on my phone， so your second。

 text always find out， availability， it's like， what's your， schedule like， this week？。

 what's your schedule， like， next week？， okay？， or what are you， free next week？， okay？。

 you find out， availability， now when you send， the second text， let's say， she now replies。

 so she replies to， your second text， with her， if she replies， with her， availability， you send。

 you a third text， your third text， is always setting， it up， when， where， what？， okay？。

 even if she says， I am busy next week， or sorry I'm busy， or even like， not giving her。

 availability， you can， still send， the same， third text， okay？， it's just， a third text。

 could even be， it's what I call， like a set-up text， where you set-up the date， or it's like a。

 persistent text， where you're being， a little bit more persistent， okay？， it's like almost。

 universal， you can send these， three-tier text， to any girl， so your third text。

 is along the lines of， so for me， I send， something along the lines， of like， okay。

 so give me two scenarios， let's say， one， she's， giving me her availability， so I'm free this day。

 this day， like， oh， I work， say she sends me， her work schedule， I work this day， this time。

 this day， this day， it's still telling me， what day she's， not working， do you understand that？。

 so even if she tells， it， like， as long as， she gives you some， sort of time or date， it means。

 that she's， interested， move forward， you've got to make， something happen， only when she goes， oh。

 sorry， I'm busy， or it's like no， replies at all， that's kind of like， more of a， resistant。

 that's more of， kind of like， objection， like， kind of going cold， you're good to go， okay。

 and on your， third text， I usually， just go cool， you know， based on what， she said。

 I'll be like cool， Tuesday night， maybe for tea， and a venture， Rob's square， 3pm， question mark。

 okay， I always， set the time， sorry， I always set the， location and date， and that I ask about the。

 time， do you get it？， yeah， because you want to set， the location， because it's got to do。

 with logistics， you want to set the， date， but let her， kind of like， see what time is。

 good for her， so we should， give me her， availability， I kind of always， always ask like， 3pm， 2pm。

 so I'll be like， maybe for， tea and a venture， in downtown， Tuesday， 3pm， question mark， or 2pm。

 question mark， okay， now let's say， she sends me， like， oh， sorry， I'm， busy， so second-senior。

 and she's like， oh， I'm， busy， so then my third text， is not like， it's not like， place， date， time。

 it's not like that， anymore， it's gonna be like， okay， cool， meet me for tea， downtown。

 which day is good for you， you see that？， you're still setting it， up but you're being。

 a little bit more persistent， okay， and I'll show you， guys all examples， of these。

 do you think it's， a lot， that has to be， like， school road， station if they live， downtown， yeah。

 it's quite， it depends how， invest， like， again， it， depends on my first， initial introduction。

 how much chemistry， you guys have， like， if， she's really， investing in you， she， really likes you。

 she'll probably make her， way down there， right？， but let's say， like， you， just met。

 that it happened， yeah， exactly， like， I'm， sure you've had it， happened， so， if， like， if。

 she's not， willing to go down there， then， you have to meet， her somewhere else， like， there's。

 some girls have， when they meet you， their， investment， levels， they're on。

 different levels in terms， of how， how， much they want to， meet you， it's， all different， so you。

 have to find out。， like， some girls， don't want to come all， the way down to， me， like， say some。

 girls' enrichment， they， don't want to come， all the way down to， me， they're like， me。

 me enrichment， I'll be， like， okay， sure。， right？ I mean， I， like， I， drive， so it doesn't。

 matter for me， but at， least that tells me， like，， she's not that committed。， So when I meet。

 up with her for the， first time， you， know， I have， some way to do。， Right？ I got to。

 basically create more， connection or more， chemistry between her， and I。 But if a， girls have。

 willing to come， downtown and meet me， here， I don't， she's invested， she's， very， she's very。

 intimate。 So the， chance to be， pulling is really， high。 Right？， Yeah。 Basically， what this is。

 it's， like， they're， compliance。 Right？ Like，， getting them to， come out of date and。

 set up the date and， and stuff like that， like， we're to meet， you're， to be able to， get a girl's。

 compliance level。 If， she's a very high， compliance level， she's， very into you。 The， chance to be。

 closing is quite， high。 But let's say， she's not， like， she's， not willing to go that， far。

 it's not， willing to come to you。 Then， you know， it's very， low compliance level。 Does。

 that make sense？ Yeah。 I， think it's pretty， like，， common sense is， like，， pretty standard。 Yeah。

 So， okay， so with your， third text， you're， setting up the date。 Okay？ Or。

 you're being a little bit， persistent， if she doesn't， replies。 Like， which day is， good for you？

 Okay？ And， I sometimes， put， like， a， email comment and， I don't know if you're， going to get a。

 girl's， comment。 Now， these three， texts， the structure of this， is I usually get a girl。

 to come out of， see me within three text，， five maximum。 Okay？ Three， minimum， five maximum。 I。

 don't say any more than five， text。 I usually don't。 Unless， it's like a special。

 situation where the girl， just likes texting me， all this shit back and forth。， Yeah。 From when you。

 read her or from when you， text her， it says， like，， Wednesday and the dates， on Saturday。 Yeah。

 You， text her between， the day and the day。 Okay？， Yeah。 Very good， question。 So let's say you。

 text her in the beginning， of the week and you， meeting on the weekend。 Say， there's like five， six。

 days or whatever in， between or there might， be a week in between。 Okay？， There is a chance of her。

 flaking if you don't engage， her during those days。 She， might even forget about， the date。

 Because for a， girl， like， there's a lot， of shit going on in her， life， right？ Unless she。

 does nothing with her， life， sit at home and， fucking play video games，， like， you know， like some。

 dudes。 But generally， if， you set up the date， let's， see how me to grow。

 today and I already set up a， date tonight。 But it's， for like， let's say， end of， the week。

 And I don't see， it for five， six days。， What am I going to do？ Is， I am actually a case of what。

 I do， personally， is I'm， going to pick up the phone。， I'm going to dial her， number。

 I'm going to call her， and talk to her on the phone， during the week in the， middle of the week。 So。

 two， three days later， I'll， call her。 I'll call her， just to lure her here my。

 voice again and over the， phone， I came her over， the phone and pumps， some emotions。 I've。

 got some jokes。， And I'll tell you what， calling， is one of the most effective。

 things you can do because no， guys ever calls。 One， time I called a girl， she， was so， like， almost。

 every girl that I call， they're so blown away，， especially off， Tinder。 You know， you know，。

 it's crazy about， Tinder。 Like， I， should put this in my， Tinder program as well。 It's， like。

 when I get girls， numbers on Tinder， I， don't text them at all。 I， fucking call them。 I literally。

 call them and get them on， the phone and let them hear， my voice。 Because I know。

 that no guy ever calls， them。 I'm going to call， them。 I'm going to call， them。 I'm going to call。

 them。 Every guy ever calls， them。 No guy。 Every guy， just tests。 Because that's， safe。 Exactly。

 That's why， I call this one girl。， And she， she， actually test our， testing back afterwards。 There。

 you go。 Right？ It's so， effective because no guy， ever calls。 No guy knows， what to say。 Like。

 you don't even know what the， fuck to say on the phone。 I， find it more intimidating to。

 call a girl。 It's just， a pro trim person。 Good。 See， that？ Because that's how。

 every other guy feels。 That's， what nobody calls。 I fucking， call a girl。 They're so， blown away。

 And I can tell， that they've blown away and， I generally see something like， well， judging by their。
