應曾經為安穌，and if we count on a lot of these girls especially in nightclubs。

 and they're so used to guys buying them drinks， they're so used to guys going up and complements them on their looks。

 they're so used to guys just doing all this shit for them， because they're beautiful。

 and the moment that you can strip the validation， off of her being beautiful。

 whereas let's say her beauty has no effect， it has no effect on you whatsoever。

 the moment you should realize that， you have successfully stripped her validation，005， alright。

我是 not notice 因為我見到，能否認識，啊 就是必須提高，所以這些時好處，應該會發作 Lashiter教 ippyn，好，在我刻期中，東西回落，放心 p，攝得的，就會擺去，對啊。

我乾脆 Private，假的，他觉得你是一 bol，想想考ında了，The only reason that you put her on such a fucking pedestal。

 is because everyone else does， her perceived value from everybody is super fucking high。

 So you think that she is super high value and out of your leak， At the end of the day。

 she's just a girl with a job， or still in school， And the fact that people are putting on a pedestal。

 is because the way they look， is because they're just people who are good looking。

 They got lucky in the gym pool， If a girl tells you she's a model。

 like it's really just a profession， it's got nothing to do with how awesome she is。

 it's got nothing to do with， her personality， how much value she brings to the table。

 if she's actually an awesome and cool person， if she's even going to bring value to your life。

 it's got nothing to do with that， So when a girl tells me and breaks about。

 maybe what car she drives or， what she does for work， or things like， oh she's a cocktail waitress。

 those things are all hinting like， oh I'm hot and I don't show the fact that I'm impressed。

 the usual answers I get， like I have no emotional reaction to it， whatsoever。

 like if a girl tells me like oh I'm a model， I'm like cool。

 interesting like how did you get that job， you know how did you get that job。

 or like some girls like you know what， I'm a calendar model， like I fly out to Miami。

 you know like fucking twice a year， blah blah blah， and I was like， I doubt it。

 and the girl like it was on her phone， like she shows me all this shit like trying hard。

 to convey value， okay see you how just trying to the fucking table around。

 okay you're trying to make， so the girl becomes the one who's trying to， hard to convey value。

 trying hard to make you， accept and like her， okay and you're the guy who's a buyer。

 and almost like looking at your options， like okay what's great about this， what's great about this。

 what's great about this， you're the one choosing， okay now when you do that。

 the entire courtship becomes a lot， easier for you， okay qualification is such a。

 fucking powerful concept， that it's not only use， it's not only such a powerful concept。

 and pick them dating， but it's one of the most， constant important concepts。

 that you can use in your life， you know whether it's your interview， for a job。

 whether you're trying to hire people， whether you're trying to interview。

 or or or or you're somebody who's， getting interviewed， buy someone you're trying to get a job。

 um and many many aspects， such as negotiation， and you know when you're buying a house。

 when you're buying anything and you want， to ask for a discount， it's one of the most powerful ways。

 to communicate， and turning the tables around， where the power shifts onto your side。

 okay that's why qualification is so important， whereas if you look at everyone around you。

 including your friends， they're always just chasing， chasing chasing chasing。

 they're always fucking chasing the girl， and on average， through all the girls that I've ever。

 dated in my life， especially after sleeping with them， and talking to them。

 and giving them to know this information， that every single girl on average。

 has at least any given time in her life， has at least five， to about 10 guys chasing her。

 and when I say that what I mean， is texting her on a daily， okay asking her out， buying her shit。

 doing her favors， okay like that's your competition， that's the fucking competition。

 like their guys just， seeking validation chasing them， asking for permission， doing things。

 supplicating， to trying to get her to like them， and here you are， who's a guy， who has value。

 who shows that you have value， who establish your high value。

 by showing the girl that you have options， that you're picky， that you like certain qualities。

 and you don't like certain qualities， okay， and show that you are not。

 and the main thing is to show that， you are not impressed， by the things。

 that she normally gets a validation on， and the big part of it， is her beauty。

 okay don't ever show that you're impressed， by her beauty。

 when she realized that she has lost that effect on you， she will fucking chase you。

 okay。
