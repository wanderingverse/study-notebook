# PURE GAME (英语洋妞)：Wingman 僚机

Hey， what's up guys？，So in this module，， what I'm gonna talk to you about。

 is where to find a wingman， and the importance of having a wingman， and the impact that it has。

 on the development of your game， and your success， okay？， So what you need to know is。

 what you're gonna realize when you start going out a lot， is a fucking sucks to go out by yourself。

 okay？， Like it sucks to go out to a bar， a nightclub， and it sucks to go out in day game。

 if you're going out by yourself， okay？， Now， what I'm gonna say before I talk about wingman。

 is that actually a lot of your development，， a lot of your improvement is going to be made。

 when you're going out by yourself， okay？， You're gonna get most of your improvements。

 when you are going out on your own，， when you're doing approaches on your own， okay？。

 But the importance and the reason why， that you need to find a wingman。

 is that a lot of times when you're going out， and trying to learn game or learn pickup，。

 your wingman is gonna basically see what you're doing， from an outsider's point of view。

 and correct and basically tell you， what you're doing wrong or what they're seeing from you， okay？。

 So you're getting a feedback from a third person perspective， okay？。

 If someone who actually knows about games，， someone who actually goes out regularly as well。。

 And another reason is also because you wanna have a wingman， so that it keeps you motivated。。

 There are days where， you know，， back in the day when I was learning game，。

 there was days where I feel like，， you know what， I don't wanna go out today，。

 like I'm sober and out or， you know， I'm tired，， I'm feeling lazy。

 especially when you're feeling lazy，， you feel like， you know what， I don't wanna go out，。

 I don't wanna feel like it。， I just wanna set a home and play video games。。

 This is where the importance of having a wingman comes in， okay？。

 You need your wing to fucking call you up， and be like， hey man， let's go out today，。

 like no dickin' around， like stop being lazy at home，， let's go out in game， let's go out in me。

 girls。， So having wingman basically keeps each other accountable， and keep you basically motivated。

 okay？， It's almost like going to the gym and having a gym buddy。。

 So even on days where you don't feel like it，， your gym buddy's gonna be like， hey，。

 stop fucking around， let's go， okay？， And now where can you find a wingman？。

 Now a couple of things about the wingman， that you need to know is you don't ever wanna go out。

 with a guy who's negative， okay？， Never go out with a guy who's negative，， who's always negative。

 very critical of you， and always kinda puts you down， okay？。

 When you go over the guy who's really negative，， it will do more harm to you in the long run than good。

， So you wanna go over the guys who are positive，， you wanna go over the guys who are constructive，。

 you wanna go over the guys who basically have a healthy，， ego and mind， okay？。

 And where you can find a good wingman is，， now while you're learning game，。

 one of the places where you can find them is，， if you live in a big city，。

 there's always gonna be a local layer， okay？， Or like a local pickup forum or group of guys，。

 you know， on Facebook， that goes out regularly，， that post regularly， okay？。

 Now not every guy that posts regularly are actually good。。

 So what you have to do is maybe make a post， on the forum or groups saying that you wanna go。

 over someone， saying that you or somebody， that goes out regularly， you will like to find someone。

 to improve together， you will like to find a wingman。。

 Now what you'll notice is that you're the first guy， that you meet up with are not always gonna be，。

 you know， the best wingman that you ever get。， You， it's almost like， it's the same thing。

 I was finding in a girlfriend。， You have to go through about 10， 20 guys。

 to kind of find somebody who you drive with，， you know， your personality， where you match，。

 you find like， you know what，， he's gonna be a good buddy of mine。， In terms of their skill level，。

 in terms of who they are， their personality，， their ego and their mind， okay？。

 So you're gonna take you a while， before you screen out a guy who's， you know，。

 really fucking good and that you can learn from，， feed off of as well as go out with， be motivated。

 and basically have an adventure together。， Okay， so some of my best friends in my life，。

 I've actually met him through pickup。， Okay， guys that I met in the pickup community。

 and guys that are， basically I would have never met them， if I didn't get into pickup。

 if I didn't get into game。， And I've also met a lot of weird guys， okay？。

 Like you also meet a lot of weird guys in this。， Like so back then when I was trying to learn this，。

 back when I was， you know， 19， 20 years old，， I met up with just in the city that I live in。。

 So in Vancouver， I met up with about like 50 guys，， like around。

 literally around 50 guys from like the local， there and I would go as far as to say like 99% of them。

 are like really weird， okay？， They were like really weird guys who either had，， you know。

 too much ego or were too insecure， or they were a little bit autistic，， like something wrong。

 like something's wrong with them，， okay， they're a little bit off。， And that's why they're in this。

 because they need help。， And I rarely met only like those，。

 maybe like two or three guys who were actually cool，， okay。

 who were actually cool and were actually good。， And who were also， you know， positive， constructive。

， very encouraging。， So they were very few， but as soon as I locked。

 into those few guys who were good，， I made sure， made sure that I build a relationship with them。

 where I started being friends with them，， made friends with them， started going out to get on，。

 on a regular base and kind of figured out， what they were into， their interests， their personality，。

 what kind of goals they have， you know，， their background， their history，。

 it's almost like meeting someone，， it's like making new friends， okay？。

 Now having a wingman is so important，， especially when you're going out。。

 Now where that comes in is when you build， a good relationship with a wingman，。

 now if you meet somebody for the first time， and you go out， you don't know each other very well，。

 okay， like you're basically strangers， and you go out together， you're not gonna be able， to。

 you know， match up really， really well，， you're not gonna be able to like，。

 wing each other really well right off the bat，， it does take some time，。

 it's like taking two different parts of the engine，。

 putting it together and it takes time to grind it out， okay？， So once you get to know your wingman，。

 once you get to develop a guy who's really， really good，， that you can learn from。

 once you go out with him， and there's a good chemistry，， the importance of having wingman is so key。

 because a lot of times when you go out for a night game，， especially in a night club。

 we're in a bar， or any social event， you know， girls are not alone，。

 they're always with their friends， right？， You're gonna get caught block a lot in night clubs，。

 you're gonna get caught blocked a lot at parties，。

 that is where the importance of the wingman comes in， okay？。

 And one of the rules that you need to understand， is you never put down your wingman， okay？。

 You never make fun of your wingman，， you never put him down， you always have to talk， each other up。

 okay？， This is one of the most important things。， I see guys do this all the time，。

 like it's so fucking stupid，， is you have a wingman who's your buddy。

 and you go out to meet girls together， and when there's two girls， when you're in front of girls，。

 you think a lot of guys think it's cool， to put down your friend and make them look bad。。

 When you do that， it actually makes you look even worse，， okay， like you're going out with a guy。

 who you're making fun of， and by calling him names and shit，。

 like making fun of him and busing his balls，， when in reality what you should be doing。

 is working together to get the girls，， okay， pull together to get the girls。。

 So what you need to be doing is when you're in your wingman。

 and set and you want to basically isolate the girls，， say for example， okay， there's two girls，。

 when you're in your wingman， go in，， by the way， you never approach a set together， okay？。

 Try not to approach a set together。， It seems a little bit too weird， and very。

 very aggressive off the bat， because there's two guys coming in at once。。

 So what you want to do is always you or him，， one of you guys approach first。

 and then in about 20 seconds or even a minute，， you have your wingman come in or you come in。

 into the set and engage both girls。， And as soon as your wing comes in，。

 what you want to do is instead of having， one big interaction with all four of you，。

 you want to basically isolate right away， okay？， Whether it's two girls， three girls， four girls，。

 the guy who's coming into wing，， he needs to isolate the rest of them right away， okay？。

 And what you need to do is when he comes in，， make it very clear which one of the girls that you want。

， So one of the rules that I have with my wingman， is if I'm in set and I opened it。

 and there's one girl that I'm interested in，， when my wingman comes in，。

 I'm gonna introduce him to the girl that I want first。， So for example， when he comes in，， I'm like。

 oh hey， it's my friend Mike，， to the first girl， okay？， The one that I'm interested in。。

 So he knows that that's one that I'm interested in。， It's the first one that I introduce him to。。

 And then he'll talk to the rest of them， so that I have an opportunity to isolate。

 the girl that I'm into， okay？， Or have at least a one-on-one conversation with her， okay？。

 It's almost very rare where my wingman comes in， and we have like a big group interaction。。

 Because usually when you have a big group interaction，， the girls feel like they're being judged。

 right？， Sure， it's fun。， If you're having a group interaction，。

 you want to feel like that you guys are cool，， that you guys are just having a time，。

 you're cool guys， you're easy going。， But the reason why wingman's there is to wing you。

 is to keep her friends occupied， so that you don't get caught blocked， okay？。

 Now another scenario is，， let's say you're talking to a girl one-on-one， okay？。

 And out of the corner of your eye， or say it happens。

 where the friends who comes in and about to clock lock，， about to pull her away，。

 and the friends about to come in and interrupt it，， your wingman or you needs to come into that set。

 right away and keep the friend occupied right there。。

 Because you could have a really good interaction， with the girl going on right now，。

 but because her friend doesn't know who you are， and her friends never experience you，。

 they automatically assume that you're some weird， creepy，， or random dudes just heading on a friend。

， So they're gonna come，， they're thinking， the way that they're thinking。

 is they're coming in to rescue their friend。， Okay。

 so they're gonna come in and just pull the friend away， regardless who you are and what you say。。

 So at that moment， you need to either introduce yourself， and then your wingman jumps in。

 introduce him， and throw the girl onto your wingman， okay？。

 And keep her occupied while you can continue， talking to your girl， okay？。

 And make something happen，， whether it's the number close， you're trying to pull。

 or you can pull the whole group back，， but the whole， you get the point here is。

 having a wingman is so important when you go out，， especially in a social setting，。

 where if it's you versus the world，， it's very， very hard to make it happen， okay？。

 You can still do it， okay？， You can absolutely still make it work by yourself，， but it's just much。

 much harder。， Having a wingman there， not only does he disarm。

 the friends who are gonna clock walk you，， but a lot of times your wingman can also assist。

 and help you in getting the girl。， So I'll give you another example，。

 what you can do with a wingman is let's say any time， when you run out of things to say，。

 you run out of things to talk about，， what I would always do is as soon as I run out，。

 like I don't run out of things to say，， but sometimes let's say I'm talking to her for too long，。

 what I will do is I will even introduce my girl， to my wingman and I'll throw my girl on my wingman。

， so he keeps her occupied for a while， while I go off and walk around。

 or talk to her friends if we're trying to pull the whole group，， okay。

 you can't pull a group of girls， if you haven't taught to any one of them，。

 like if you haven't taught to all of them。， So if I've taught to my girl for a long time。

 and I haven't taught to her friends，， what I'll do is I'll throw my girl onto my wingman。

 in which he'll keep her occupied， and in fact， your wingman can actually brag。

 and talk about all these cool things about you， because it just looks fucking weird。

 if you're breaking about yourself，， like you never wanna brag about yourself，。

 but it is okay for your wingman to brag about you。， Saying how cool you are， saying，。

 what kind of thing， what kind of cool things you do，， what kind of cool things you have，。

 it's okay for your wingman to do that。， So in nightclub setting or a bar setting，。

 a lot of times I meet a girl，， I'll throw onto my wingman。。

 My wingman keeps her occupied for 10 minutes， while I introduce myself to all her friends。

 and make all her friends like me，， I think that I'm cool。， And then， close to the end of the night，。

 what we do is we pull the entire group back to my place。， Okay， so that's like a whole group poll。

 where it's very， very hard if you don't have a wingman。， Okay。

 so it's very important to actually go out there，， find people who are like-minded，。

 just like yourself， go out with them，， get their contact information，， go out with them。

 figure out a date，， go out regularly with them，， and you will create so much friendships，。

 you will create like literally really valuable friendships。

 through guys that you meet in the community。， Okay， but you gotta be prepared。

 that there's gonna be a lot of guys， who are just simply not gonna be your friends。。

 They're not gonna have good chemistry with you，， they're not gonna get along with you。， Okay。

 it's just kinda like when you go to school，， like there's some people that you get along with，。

 there's some people you don't get along with。， Okay， and you have to fully accept that。。

 And there's gonna be a lot of guys， that you meet are actually super weird， or socially awkward。

 doesn't mean they're bad people。， It just means that they need help。， And， you know。

 there may be guys， who are even worse than you。， Your whole goal is to find somebody who's。

 you know，， much cooler and obviously better in terms of skills。

 than you are that you can actually learn from。， But one advice I'm gonna give you。

 when you're going actively to look for a wingman， is never right away trying to take from them。。

 Okay， like don't go up desperately， and be like， hey man， you're so good。。

 Like I wanna go out with you， I wanna learn from you。。

 Because it's the same thing when you go up to a girl。。

 It's like they feel like you're just trying to take from them。。

 Like you're trying to get something from them， without giving anything in return。。

 So the same principle applies when you're making friends， when you're trying to find a cool wingman。

 is if you want them to hang out with you。， You want them to， you know， be around you。

 and like I should go out with you。， You must offer value。， You must give them value first。

 before trying to take from them。， Okay， it's the same principle that applies。。

 So what you wanna do is instead of going up like，， oh， hey man， like can you please teach me。

 like take me out with you？， Like oh my god， you're so good。， Instead of doing that， you know，。

 where they feel like you're desperate， you're needy。

 and you're like trying to get something from them。， Go up and offer something。， Okay， for example。

 let's say you're a guy， who's promoting the club。， Go up to the， like you know， once you find a guy。

 who's really good， offer him to go to the club， that you're promoting and offer him， let's say。

 free cover。， Okay， and say， you know what，， like you're hosting this this weekend。

 invite him to come。， So you're offering something first， to have him to be a part of。

 rather than you go up and try to take some shit from him。。

 It's the same shit when you're talking to girls。， It's like you're not going up to try。

 and get something from her。， You're going up to give value first， and then you can take。， Okay。

 it's going to be an exchange of value。， Okay。， Now on that note，。

 I hope you've enjoyed this video about finding a wingman。， If you have any more questions about。

 you know，， specifically about， you know，， where to find a wingman or how to find a wingman， or。

 you know， if you live in a small town， where there's not really many people， who goes out in a game。

 if you're living a small city， where you can't really find anybody，。

 you have to at least try to put yourself out there。， Use and leverage the internet。。

 If that doesn't work，， what you need to do is literally move out of where you live。

 and go to a bigger place。， Go to a bigger city。， Okay， go to a place where there's more population。

 because in those places，， it's almost a guarantee that there will be。

 a much bigger community of guys， who does pickup and self-development。， Okay。， Now on that note，。

 I'll see you guys in the next video。。
