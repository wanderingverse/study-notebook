# PURE GAME (英语洋妞)：Qualification 认可

Hey guys， now in this week's module， I'm gonna talk to you about qualification。， Okay。

 so everything is revolved around the topic of qualification。， Okay。

 now there's three main parts to it， and the first part that I'm gonna go over and talk to you guys about。

 is the idea of establishing high value。， Okay， so you understand that when it comes to getting girls and even dating as well as keeping a girl around。

， a lot of it has to do with basically what I call high value。。

 And when it comes to this whole high value thing， what I'm really talking about here is that you are somebody who has options。

， Okay， so you're not desperate， you're not needy like every other guy。。

 A lot of when it comes to communication with women。

 a lot of when it comes to dating and getting women，， guys fail because they communicate neediness。

 desperate， okay， and just no value whatsoever。， Literally。

 that's the number one reason your value drops and women， you don't get any successful women at all。。

 Okay， so you're too needy and you're too desperate。。

 So what really communicates value with women is number one， you're being real。。

 So we went over this in last week's module。， And number two is what I call establishing that high value you have is really call just like having options in your life。

， And how you demonstrate that you have options， how you demonstrate that you have abundance is by qualifying the girl。

， Okay， so a lot of guys make the mistake where they go up。

 talk to the girl and they interact with the girl。。

 Now you're able to get the positive and good reactions and get the girl to hook。。

 Now the guys like what the fuck do I do after I hook？， Okay。

 like what do you do after you've hooked？， You have to do qualification。。

 What that means is basically showing the girl that you have options and it's almost like why are you choosing her？

， So what I'm saying is for example， if you were let's say walking into a store and you want to buy a computer。

 okay， and there's tons of computers in the store。。

 And the person who's coming up trying to sell you the computers is the person who's selling to you。。

 He's basically the sales guy， okay。， The guys have the wrong idea where they think that when they're meeting girls。

 they're always trying to sell themself to the girl。， Okay。

 most guys are always trying to sell themself to a girl。。

 The idea here is that you are not trying to sell yourself to the girl。， You are the buyer。。

 You have options。， You have the resource。， You are the one choosing what to get。， Okay。

 so the moment you walk in，， the person who's trying to sell to you。

 he already knows that you want to buy。， So what he's going to do is try to tell you get this one。

 get this one or get this one。， And as a buyer， you're the one with all the options。， Okay。

 so you want to basically look for qualities like why am I buying this？。

 This is what I'm looking for。， This is what I want。， This is what I like。。

 Now what's so good about this one？， Okay， so you're basically showing that you have options。。

 So when it comes to meeting women， the whole concept here is don't be a guy who's selling yourself。。

 You want to establish yourself as a buyer。， That is why you need to qualify the girl。， So most guys。

 when they get attraction， when they get signs of investment from the girl，。

 they pretty much jump onto it right away。， Okay， like say the girl shows that she's interested。。

 She's hooked in the interaction。， What most guys do is they think that they've got her。。

 And now they've got her。， They can just pull this girl and bounce back to her place。。

 And now this doesn't always happen because for girls to show that she likes you，。

 she doesn't have that connection where she knows that you like her as well。， Like to her。

 she's like， well， this guy is really awesome。， The way she's thinking is， this guy is awesome。。

 This guy is interesting。， But he doesn't even know me。， This guy doesn't know anything about me。。

 So when you go for the poll or when you try to move things forward，， as soon as you've hooked。

 basically what she feels like is one。， She feels like a slut for going with you because she thinks that you know nothing about her。

， You don't even care or that you only like her for her looks，， which is very common。。

 Every fucking guy likes her for her looks。， So that is why you have to qualify。。

 You have to show the girl that you actually find her attractive more than just her looks。。

 It's got to be some other attributes or some other qualities。， And I'll give examples in a second。。

 So this whole idea here is really to establish that you have high value。， You are a chooser。

 you are a buyer。， You never sell yourself to the girl。， You're turning the tables around。。

 You're making her work for your attention， work for your interests。， So for example。

 usually when I hook， after I've hooked the girl，， I will always qualify the girl on qualities that's to do with。

 let's say， her personality。， So one way to do it is to compliment her on her personality。

 compliment her on things， that are what I call not really visible。。

 Not things like the way she looks， not on her clothing， nothing external。。

 So you want to compliment on things like her personality， her vibe， her energy，。

 maybe even what she does for work。， So things that you can't really see and look。

 things that are not very generic。， So I'll give example。

 sometimes I'll talk to a girl and as soon as she hooks，， we talk for a little bit。

 I know she's really into me。， And I might drop lines such as， you know， like， you know，。

 what I really like about you and the girl is like， what？。

 They want to know what you really like about her。， And I'll say things like， you know what？。

 I love your energy。， It's really fucking awesome。， I love your vibe。。

 And it makes me feel really cool that I can meet someone in this place，， usually a nightclub。

 meet somebody here。， And I actually feel really comfortable talking to you。， Like I feel， you know。

 you don't make me nervous。， You make me really comfortable。。

 And I feel like we can connect to some levels。， That's really awesome。， Good for you。， Okay。

 so I would， I would basically compliment her on things like that。， Okay。

 so things that's basically just who she is。， And almost she looks like， not what she's wearing。

 not how， you know，， how big her boobs are， not how nice her ass is。。

 Because that's literally what every guy gives her validation on。。

 You want to basically give her validation on things that she value，， which is who she is。

 And this is extremely， extremely important， to getting really， really， really hog girls。。

 Because every， every fucking guy tells them，， oh， you're so beautiful。， Oh， you're so gorgeous。。

 You know， all like your boobs， like， especially girls。

 who like post their photos on Instagram on Facebook。， You know。

 if they're boobs and like all those selfies，， they're expecting。， Okay。

 they're expecting every guy to compliment them on the looks。， And here you are。

 some guy that comes up and you're talking to them。， And you're giving them validation on shit。

 that they really truly care about。， Okay， it's like who they are。， Okay， so that's really。

 really important。， So that's really important when it comes to establishing high value。， Okay。

 and there's other things that you can ask her。， Like， you know what， you seem pretty awesome。。

 I mean， like you are beautiful， but what do you do for fun？， It's like， what do you do for fun？。

 Or you know， asking questions like，， what is the coolest thing you've ever done in your life？， Okay。

 or like， what's the coolest place you've ever been in your life？。

 So when you're asking those kind of things，， it's like you're qualifying her to see if she's got more than just what she looks like。

， All those things establish the fact that you're a high value， you're a buyer。。

 It's like you don't just settle down for， you know， whatever you can get。。

 But rather you are choosing。， You're basically saying， I say， no， a lot more than I say yes。。

 Sometimes I even verbalize that。， I'll tell a girl like， I say no， a lot more than I say yes。。

 It's like， I have options。 I have abundance。， In that case， it actually makes her value you more。。

 And the girl will actually want to work for your attention， work for your interest。。

 A lot more say than just， you know， meeting some random dude，。

 where the guy jumps on her as soon as she shows like a little bit of interest。， A lot of guys。

 a lot of intermediate guys make this mistake where they go in， they're open。， They'll， you know。

 go up and express themselves。， And as soon as they get some sort of like interest from her，。

 as soon as the girl is like， you know， kind of into the interaction，。

 they feel like they've got her and they start just acting needy and desperate，。

 like needing it to happen， like jumping onto her，， trying， going for the pole prematurely，。

 going for the kiss prematurely， when to her， she's like，， this motherfucker doesn't even know me。

 right？， So you get what I call buyers remorse。， If you don't qualify， you will get buyers remorse。

 and you will not be able to move the interaction forward。， And in fact， if you're asking me。

 when should I start qualifying the girl？， Funny enough。

 sometimes I qualify the girl right off the bat。， Okay。

 you want to basically qualify the girl at every single stage of the interaction。， Okay。

 almost on every little thing or，， you're not doing it the entire time。， I was throwing。

 like I was throwing things to qualify her，， like， you know， maybe like every two， three minutes。

 something like that。， But I could start qualifying right in the beginning of the interaction。。

 Like literally the moment I approached， I could literally go up and，， you know。

 use something very direct， like， excuse me， you're very attractive。， Nice to meet you。

 are you cool though？， Right， I can literally be like， are you cool？， What did you do for work？。

 I could start qualifying her as soon as I approach。， And then as we progress， as we go on。

 I give her validation。， Okay， I compliment her on things that's actually who she is。
