你自己，这个，我们，很多仙谱，山西，这个，你 never want to look at that way，你 always want to just focus on your progress。

 So rather than looking at it from， a batting average point of view。

 you want to see your entire night as a total progress， as one whole progress。

 and basically you want to base how good or how， I guess how much improvement you've made。

 based on the amount of action you've taken， based on the things that you're actually doing。

 and what you're not doing， So the example for that is， let's say on a night out。

 even if you get blown out by every girl you talk to， rather than thinking about it。

 that you're like one for ten or zero for ten， think about like what did I do really good tonight。

 and what can I have done better， and what I didn't do really well tonight。

 think about things that's actually constructive， it's kind of a waste of time and pointless。

 to think about your batting average， because it doesn't help you， it doesn't serve you in any way。

 over the course of however long you're going out， rather than that you want to think about。

 how it can actually help you in a constructive way， so rather than think about like the numbers。

 think about what you did wrong， think about what you did good， if you focus on that in the long run。

 then more consistent results will come， and that's how you use those blowouts and rejections。

 to actually help you in the long run， not no statistics。

 and the thing is you are going to get more blowouts， just keep that in mind。

 you will get more blowouts in the beginning， but obviously the more you go out。

 the more I guess like， the more action you take， the more blowouts you are going to get。

 the guys who don't get blowouts are the ones， who don't take action at all。

 the fact that you're even getting blowouts， or you're getting rejected， it's a good sign。

 means you're taking a lot of action， so a lot of times。

 when you're going to encounter in night game， when you go out especially in night clubs， or parties。

 because girls get approached so much by dudes， like at these social events。

 they will naturally have these bit shield， where the moment you approach。

 if you kind of go up like every other guy， because so many guys approaches。

 it's always almost every single time， that you're going to get a negative reaction off the bat。

 it's like they're bit shield， it's meant to kind of filter all the guys。

 that are drunk and constantly approaching， and basically the chose。

 and the way that you want to get through the bit shield。

 basically is you're going to be a little bit more persistent， so let's say when a guy。

 approaches or when you approach， and the girl is kind of giving you a bit of。

 a negative reaction off the bat， don't take it as a rejection， the rule is。

 if a girl is staying there， and she's still standing there， as you're approaching her。

 and you're talking and the girl stays， it's always on， unless she leaves。

 if a girl really doesn't want to talk to you， and she doesn't like you。

 move herself from the current situation， but if the girl stays， and talks to you， it is always on。

 you have to be a little bit more persistent， don't give up so easily， because every guy gives up so。

 fucking easily， literally when you're approaching， at the first sign， of a little bit of resistance。

 or a little bit of kind of like， blow off because she doesn't know you。

 give it a little bit more chance， stay in there， stick in there for like another， at least 10-20%。

 okay just talk a little bit more， like let her experience a little bit more， who you are。

 and if after that， the girl walks away， move the fuck on， okay but if she's there。

 keep talking to her， and the final thing， that I want to say about rejections。

 is that you want the way that you will use rejections， to pump your own state。

 is that whenever you get blown out by a girl， make sure you find something interesting or funny。

 like make sure it's always got to be， something funny about the interaction。

 be able to laugh for yourself， don't fucking take yourself seriously。

 never take anything of a girl's zest to you， personal， for example like guys would go out。

 a girl would make a comment about， his shirt or the way he's dressed， oh you look like a nerd。

 oh my god your shirt is okay， and that would be such like。

 they would feel it so much on a personal level， where， their entire validation。

 their entire purpose， as a fucking man， is completely destroyed， because some girl may。

 make fun of his shirt， never take anything of a girl seriously， especially the girl doesn't even。

 know who you are， and you don't know who she is， it's just this， random platonic encounter。

 in your life， and you take it so serious， too hard that it actually hurts your ego。

 it actually hurts your confidence， seriously and that main thing is。

 don't fucking take yourself seriously， you want to think of everything like， it's kind of a joke。

 it really is， when you go for a night game， you look around you。

 you see all the guys trying to get into the girls' pants， and see all these girls， spend hours。

 dressed up， and they're playing hard to get， and all this shit， it's literally such a fucking joke。

 you can't possibly take anything seriously， okay， aside from that， when you get blown out。

 you want to find something funny about every interaction， like laugh for yourself。

 be able to laugh for yourself， be able to make fun of it， something funny， when a girl blows me out。

 when a girl rejects me， I remember when I used to go out， when girls used to blow me off。

 right off the approach， I would literally be like， use that to pump your state up。

 it's like the element of like self-immuse， okay like self-immuse， even if you get blown out so what。

 okay， okay on that note， check out the next video。

 see you next time。
