# PURE GAME (英语洋妞)：Closing 收场

Hey guys， so now in this video， I'm gonna talk to you everything that you need to know about closing。

， Okay， now there are only two types of closing ever， okay， in any situation。， So the first one。

 which should always be your goal， is to F-close， okay。

 which is bringing the girl about to your place， have sex with her and create a relationship。， Okay。

 that should always be your number one goal over number closing， okay。

 so there's too many guys who just simply settle for the number。， Basically。

 what you're doing if you're selling for number， the number should always be a plan B。。

 But the moment when you make the number of your plan A， you are not reaching your full potential。。

 You are not doing everything in your power that you can to make something happen。， You are stalling。

 okay， anytime you go for a plan B， you go for number closing on all your interactions，。

 you're basically leaving it up to a more chance， okay。

 there's more chance and more time for you not to see this girl again。， Okay。

 for you to never see each other again， for things to kind of go wrong， and for something to happen。

 and you're never going to date with this girl。， So instead， the F-close。

 the pull should always be your first number one option。， And the way you do that。

 I mentioned it in the last video， is to figure out her logistics。， Okay。

 when a girl has good logistics， you can go for the pull， okay， and don't be afraid to do it。。

 And when I'm talking about closing here now， is assuming that。

 let's say you've pulled the girl back to your place。， Okay， so assuming that you have， you know。

 as you've hooked the girl and you're walking with her now。

 and you're pulling this girl back to your house，， so assume that you're doing all that now。

 and as you basically get to your house， a lot of objections might come up。， Okay。

 so this is where you handle things before the close。， So let's say you're walking to your house。

 and girls are saying things like， oh， where are we going？， Or like， are we going back to your house？

 Are you， where are you taking me？ What are we going to do？， So let's say those things come up。

 those questions come up， and they do for every single guy that pulls。。

 What you need to do to handle this is you have to stay really calm， relaxed。

 and that nothing they say to you is a big fucking deal。。

 The moment they ask you one of those questions， where's the shit test？， You know， as you're pulling。

 the moment you panic and you emotionally react， and you start explaining yourself。

 you start to justify where you're going or what you're going to do， you're going to lose the girl。。

 Okay， you are going to lose her 100%， she's not going to come with you。

 She's going to feel uncomfortable because you're， you don't believe in what you're doing。。

 So when you're pulling the girl and she's coming up with those questions。

 don't fucking emotionally react。， Okay， if you know all of it， so for example， if a girl asks me。

 oh， where are we going？ I say something like， I would just down the block two minutes， blah， blah。

 I was just taking her to my building。， You'll even see in my infield videos where the girl。

 where the girl goes， is this your house？ Is this your apartment？ You're taking me to your apartment？

， Right， so those questions will come up。 Oh， she's coming in with me。 It's like she doesn't even。

 like， does she not know this is my fucking place as I'm taking her into an apartment with my keys opening the door。

， So I'll say things like， yeah， it's my apartment。 It's really cool。 It's moved here。

 I've got a fish tank。 I want to show it to you。， And just go in the elevator。 Okay。

 and you'll see this on video where it actually happens。， Where I stay very calm。

 cool and collected as I handle the objection and she comes in with me goes up to my place。。

 Because the whole point is you want to see that you're a man who's in control。 You're not panicking。

 You're not reacting。， You know what you're doing。 That's all she wants to fucking know is you know what you're doing。

， So， so that's the objection handling before you actually try to close。 Okay。 Now。

 once she's entered your place， how are you going to F close？， Okay。

 a lot of guys don't know what to do once girl enters your place。。

 And the number one thing you need to know is when the girl enters your place， just the environment。。

 Okay， just your house。 You should kind of set it up for the closing。

 So try to keep your place clean。， Okay， try to keep your place clean。

 Don't have too much shit laying around。， Have you placed smell good？ First of all， okay。

 if your place smells bad， clean shut up， throw out the garbage， use for breeze。。

 Nothing turns a woman off then come into a house and have shit laying around and smells really fucking bad。

， Because that will lower your rate of closing because it turns people off。。

 So have the house smell really good。 Have it really clean。 And have your lights kind of dim down。。

 Okay， so don't have like big fucking lies born in her face。 Okay， never have that。， Basically。

 you want to be comfortable in your place。 Okay， so that's how you kind of set up your house for it。。

 And have you know， couple of drinks in your fridge that you can make her if she wants the drink。。

 Always have those things ready and maybe even a few board games or video games and Netflix。

 you know， laying around and having ready to go。， And the moment she enters your house。

 there are couple of signs。 Okay， so this is from basically the last seven years of me going out and seeing it from my own personal experience I have。

 you know， hundreds， thousands of girls coming around my house and seeing this is that。

 if the moment the girl enters your house and she's taking her jacket off。

 she's taking her shoes off， just taking her clothes off and putting her bag down and hang up her jacket。

， It's a sign that she's comfortable with you at your place。

 And the chance of you closing her is much higher。 Okay。

 but if the girl comes into your house and you see that she's just kind of like standing around。

 scanning the room， her clothes are on her， even she keeps her bag on。， And she just walks in。

 not very comfortable。 It shows that you can't just close her right away。

 You can't just go for the sex right away。， You have to kind of hang out with her a little bit in your house。

 maybe make her drink， play some board games， talk a little bit。

 play some video games until she's comfortable， you know。

 takes her clothes off and then you can kind of go for it。， Those ones， if you go for it right away。

 you're going to spit the girl and she's going to fucking leave because that's usually almost what happens。

 So based on that， it's literally the biggest sign to know whether you can kind of go for it or not。。

 Another thing you need to know is when you enter your house。

 don't be like how you were outside and it's like friendly social vibe。。

 A roommate that I used to live with， he always come in to the house。 Now for， I think， six months。

 okay， for half a year， every girl he would bring into the house，， he would talk the same way to her。

 like the same vibe， as if he just first met her， like the social friendly vibe。

 like being like loud， like， hey， what's up， like this is my house， come on in。

 like it's fucking awesome， come check it out。， You know， he comes in like that。

 And the moment I hear him come in with a girl like that。

 I know he's not going to close because the vibe is just too social， it's too friendly。。

 It's like you're not in that seduction mode。 So when you come into the house。

 your vibe really matters。 You have to start toning your voice down， toning your energy down。。

 Be more chill， be more relaxed， be more low energy and be more seductive。。

 Just because you are not talking as loud， doesn't mean it takes away the intensity。

 doesn't mean it takes away the sexuality。 In fact， you want to slow things down。

 So when I come in with a girl， it's more like， yeah， come on in， like， check it out。。

 This is where I live。 It's my house。 I know it's kind of， I just moved in here。

 It's actually quite nice。， The view is not bad， but yeah， the windows are so there。

 Do you want to drink？ Right？ So it's more chill， more seductive， more slow。

 The main thing is to slow things down and toning the energy down。。

 And as she's checking out your house， what I would do。

 I would kind of look at her as she's checking out my house， make her drink。

 ask her if she wants to drink， be casual。， And then I was just looking at my window or she was checking something out in my place。

 like say， for example， my bookshelf。 Okay， with all my sub-action， pick up books with all myself。

 help books in there。， And she'll check out my shelf。 This girl is like， see the game。 I'm like。

 what's this？ Right？ Or should let's say， look at my window and look at my view or whatever is on my desk。

 She'll kind of look at those things。 I was just checking things out。， I will walk slowly。

 closer to her， and physically escalate。 Hold her like she's my girlfriends。 Hold her from behind。

 Like she's my girlfriend， hug her。 And kiss her on the neck， kiss her on her forehead。。

 And then move in for the kiss， make out with her， turn her around。 As I make an author。

 grab her by the hair， grab her butt， or hold her by the waist， escalate fully。。

 And then even pick her up and then pick her up， walk her to my bedroom， throw her on my bed。

 and just like， fold out， passionate sex。， Okay， so that's normally what I would do。。

 Or there's other times where， let's say， pull her home from a nightclub。

 and we know exactly what's up。， It's going to go down， sex is going to go down。

 It's going to happen。 It's passionate。 She's into it。 And the moment I bring her into my house。

 I just bone， pin her against the wall， grab her hair， make out with her， just passionately。。

 And basically just close her there and then。 Okay。 Now the second type of clothes， number clothes。

 Now you only go for a number clothes。， If the entire pole or instant date doesn't happen。

 and you find this out from logistics， so the way that you make number closing， you know， solid。

 and now have to go flake on you， have her text back。。

 There's a couple of things you need to do is what I call seating。

 The most important thing is the seed。， What seating is。

 is basically the idea that you're planting a seat in her head for the future。

 You're hammering in her head。 Who you are， what you're going to do， which is available。

 and she's going to come on and see you。， So before I get a girls number。

 I always have to suggest when， where， what？ So for example， I meet a girl， I'm like。

 what are you up to right now？， And she's like， oh， I'm late for work。 I got to go to work。

 And I told her， I know， okay， I'm like， listen， I know you got to go。。

 How do you feel about meeting me for a tea and adventure next week in downtown？

 Do you live around here？ Awesome。 How about I text you？， I'll send you。

 I'll send you my name so that you'll know what's me。 What's your number？ Okay。

 so you always kind of see that you always suggest the date， you always plan something solid， solid。

 so that when you actually text her， that reminds her of who it is and what you're going to do。。

 And one thing to also， second thing also， that's going to give you a solid number close is to never number close a girl on a high。

， Okay， so let's say you're in a club or you're at a， during the day game。

 you don't number close when she has an emotional spike。。

 Let's say when her energy is super high up and you get her number。

 the next thing when you're texting her again， she's not in that same state。

 she's not in that same emotional state as when you first met her。， Usually when you text a girl。

 she's at home， her energy level is like all time low， it's like super low。

 It's like when she's just like kind of like laying in her bed or sitting around reading and your text message pop up。

， She's not in that same state of like when you were pumping up her energy。

 when she's super high energy and happy and you got her number。。

 So she doesn't have that exact same feeling and you're like coming me for tea。

 she's going to be like， I don't feel like it。， Okay。

 so you always want to basically bring her energy down a little bit。

 So when you're getting the number， you always slow down， okay。

 be a little bit more logical and say like， you know what， are you free next week？。

 Why don't let's go for a tea and a venture next week in downtown， you and me。。

 If the first five minutes sucks， you can leave。， How do you feel about that？ Okay。

 make a super logical， the closing， you have to be super fucking logical with a number。。

 So that when she looks at your text， when she's in this logical mode。

 she's actually going to text you back and actually want to come out and see。。

 Like that actually has to make sense， that process has to make sense to her。， Okay。

 and that's how you reduce my flakery and get almost every girl to text me back。

 have them come out and see me on a date and close them。， Okay。

 but you only go for the number if the logistics is bad。， You can't go somewhere with her now。

 You cannot， you absolutely cannot make something happen now。。

 Then you plant a seed for a date for the future。， You make it very specific what you're going to do。

 win where what and then you get the number。， Okay， and text are within the first two hours。。

 So for exactly how to text and set it up， watch the module on texting。， Okay， and you know。

 everything on dates， watch the text and date videos to get the exact details on those things。。

 But in terms of the two types of closing is F-close， number close， and always F-close。

 always go for the pole。， First， no matter what day or night， irrelevant。

 always go for the pole first。， If the pole doesn't happen， then you seed get number。， Alright。

 on that note， I will see you guys next time。。
